## Embed your map and modify it

Oskari provides a possibility to create embedded maps to your own site. 
This is convenient for private persons and associations which don't have the possibility to create their own map service. 
You can test this feature with Oskari instance that has allowed published maps funcitonality. 

The embedded map can be added to your own web site with iframe code which you can slip between your existing web page html-code. 
When the publishing has been done, you can afterwards change the layers or add features to your published map without changing the code in the web site. 

1. Sign in to your Oskari instance
2. Choose layers you want to publish. Remember, not all dataset lisences allow publishing!
3. Click "Map Publishing"
4. A dialogue for creating embedded maps appears
