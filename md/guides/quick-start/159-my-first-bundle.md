# Quick Start to Oskari development

* Download sources from [here](/download)
* Extract the files from the downloaded archive
* Open `/applications/sample/myfirst/index.html` in your browser and you should see:

![My first bundle](/images/quick-start/myfirst.png)

This is the map application with only OpenLayers and the core of Oskari downloaded with a custom 'Hello World' bundle added as extension.

To add new funtionality to the application we add another bundle to it:

* Open `/applications/sample/myfirst/appsetupconfig.json` file in an editor
* Find the a bundle block for `myfirstbundle` and append the following `mysecondbundle` after it (remember to separate the blocks with a comma):

```javascript
{
    "bundlename" : "mysecondbundle",
    "metadata" : {
        "Import-Bundle" : {
            "mysecondbundle" : {
                "bundlePath" : "../../../packages/sample/bundle/"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

* Reload `index.html` on your browser and click the map. You should get another message alert whenever you click the map. This is the functionality added by `mysecondbundle`: it listens to an Oskari Event and reacts to it by showing an alert.
* If you open `/applications/sample/mysecond/index.html` in your browser you will have the same functionality without the Hello World alert on startup.
