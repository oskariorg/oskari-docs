## Adding your own data to Oskari instance

One of the key features in Oskari is the possibility to add your own spatial datasets and individual features to the map. 
If you are about to set up your own Oskari, think about also if you want to allow your users to create data and share it with others. 

One example instance where you can do test this fairly easily is the Finnish national SDI portal called [Paikkatietoikkuna](www.paikkatietoikkuna.fi). 

There is currently two options to add your own data to the map: individual points, lines or areas and importing ready made spatial datasets. These are now two different tools but it has been suggested that these features are going to be merged more tightly together.  So stay toned for improvements!

You can also share your datasets to your customers or colleagues through "Map Publishing" tool.

### Adding datasets

1. Register/sign in first to your Oskari instance
2. After signing in, there is a toolbar available where you can download your own datasets in zip-format (.shp, .mif/mid, .gpx or .kml) or you can add points, lines or areas. Import your own datasets.
