# Oskari architecture

### The big picture

Oskari helps businesses and municipalities
offer better online and mobile map services
to their citizens and consumers.

It is not a turnkey solution, but instead provides software components used in online service creation,
leveraging geospatial data from standardised APIs.

The Platform integrates
off-the-shelf Open Source geographical software products
with off-the-shelf Open Source software libraries
and custom Oskari software components
to allow the interleaving and integration of many different sources of geographical and statistical data
into online map visualizations
that help power e-government services and decisionmaking processes.

### The component architecture

Oskari includes a frontend, a backend and in the future also a service bus.

The user interface is implemented in JavaScript and the server functionality in Java.

The picture below shows the components of Oskari.

For a more detailed view of the architecture, see the [frontend architecture](/documentation/development/architecture) and the [backend architecture](/documentation/architecture/components) documents.
