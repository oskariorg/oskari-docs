# Oskari Permissions

The maven module under `service-permissions` provides a generic permission handling database. Two db tables (`oskari_resource` and `oskari_permission`) are used to control access rights to layers and bundles. 

## Example: grant view permission for maplayer

We want to grant access for guest users to see a maplayer:

* assume guests have role with id 10110 (configurable in `UserService` implementation)

* assume layer wmsurl is http://www.oskari.org

* assume layer wmsname is oskari

The maplayer needs to be registered as a resource for permissions db (since the permission implementation is generic).

### oskari_resource

    | resource_type | resource_mapping                        |
    |---------------|-----------------------------------------|
    | maplayer      | layertype+http://www.oskari.org+oskari  |


* `resource_type` is a string reference to another table for example in this case `oskari_maplayer`.

* `resource_mapping` is a table specific reference to the resource in question. For maplayers its url+name since this combination references to an actual unique service. The value could be the layer's id in `oskari_maplayer`, but then one could insert a layer for some url and then after receiving permissions change the layer to a completely different service (in this case the person granting permissions might be another than the one adding/modifying the actual layer).

After the layer has been added as a resouce we need to map the actual permissions

### oskari_permission

    | oskari_resource_id | permission    | external_type | external_id |
    |--------------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
    | 1                  | EDIT_LAYER    | ROLE          | 10110       |


* `oskari_resource_id` is reference to a row in `oskari_resource` table

* `permission` is a constant value of the type of permission in question

* `external_type` is a reference link for the `external_id`. Usually permissions are mapped for user roles so you the value is then 'ROLE' which means `external_id` is a role id. Another possible external_type is 'USER' which means `external_id` is a user id, but this isn't widely used or might not be supported in all cases. Recommented use for now is to only use ROLE mappings.

#### Permission types

* VIEW_LAYER: Permission to view a layer

* PUBLISH: Permission to publish a layer/use when creating an embedded map

* VIEW_PUBLISHED: Permission to view a layer in a published/embedded map

* EDIT_LAYER: Permission to modify a layer

## Example: grant permission to add layers (for non-admin user role)

Adding layers is currently a generic permission (not mapped to data producer or similar). We need to add a resource for "generic-functionality".

### oskari_resource

    | resource_type | Resource_mapping              |
    |---------------|-------------------------------|
    | Bundle        | generic-functionality         |

### oskari_permission

    | oskari_resource_id | permission    | external_type | external_id |
    |--------------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
    | 2                  | ADD_MAPLAYER  | ROLE          | 10110       |


## Admin layer rights

There is an `admin-layerrights` bundle with which admins can set layers' permissions. Check [adding bundles](/documentation/backend/adding-bundles) for how to add the bundle.
When the bundle is added a role can be chosen and rights for that role for each layer can be set through the Layer Right view.
