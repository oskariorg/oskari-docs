## Oskari Commercial Support

There are a number of organizations in the Oskari community that offer commercial support for Oskari. Support can be training, developing, installation or service management. 
Oskari is open source software and free to use but you don't always have the resources to install, manage and customize the software to your needs so commercial services are essential part of the open source ecosystem. 
If your organisation provides Oskari services commercially and is not found on the list, please make a pull request and add your information to the list.
