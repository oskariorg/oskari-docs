## Community behind the software

We are the Oskari Community: growing group of organizations, individuals and developers putting their interests together to improve and develop Oskari software.

Oskari development started already in 2008 when the first plans for Finnish national geoportal were drafted by the National Land Survey of Finland. 

In 2011 Oskari's source code was opened because the interest within other organisation for similar map services became evident. After this the utilization of Oskari has grown from public sector using Oskari in multiple ways to companies providing Oskari based services. 

The start of the actual Oskari community was in 2014 when a network for Oskari users was established in Finland and the Joint Development Forum was established. Now we have tens of organisations involved in Finland and abroad! In late 2016 [Oskari PSC](https://github.com/oskariorg/oskari-docs/wiki/Project-Steering-Committee) was established and Oskari applied for OSGeo Foundations Incubation process to gain stability and interest also in the global open source society.

Development is not just coding, it can be bug reporting, finding funding or marketing. Read  the community goals and tasks and join the development!

If you can't find resources for developing, you can always try to set up a crowd funding plan. We help you to market it through our Oskari newsletter and other media.

## Communication

If you have something Oskari related on you mind ask for ideas or support from [Oskari OSGeo mailing list](Oskari-user@lists.osgeo.org). The mailing list is open and search engines can find the discussion threads. This helps finding solutions for already asked questions.

If you need to ask something really quick, use the [Oskari Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/oskariorg/chat). Remember Gitter is really good for instant messaging, but bear in mind that the history of the discussions might not be easily found, so we encourage to use the mailing list. Please chat in English so everyone can participate in the discussion.

All communication channels are listed in [About](http://oskari.org/about).

## Meetups

Host an Oskari event or join them. We'll try to arrange [Oskari-meetups](https://www.meetup.com/Oskari-Your-geospatial-friend/) every two months - you can always ask us for a visit!

## Joint Development Forum
Oskari is being developed together. Especially the members of the Joint Development Forum are eager to find solutions and funding together. 

Oskari Project owners and current Technical coordinator (National Land Survey of Finland, NLS) have formed a Joint Development Forum (JDF) to develop Oskari together. The JDF invites all interested community members to participate in the forum activities.

1-2 organisational members are also selected to represent the whole Oskari Community during the Oskari Community Day (usually held in April-May in Finland). The selection is done by the Community.

Oskari Communication Coordinator acts as the secretary for the JDF and is guided by the JDF.

The JDF is formed by signing a contract with NLS. NLS has promised to provide technical support and counselling for the JDF Project Owners. NLS acts also as the legal person handling financial issues for the JDF. The activities of the JDF and membership payments are decided by the members of the JDF annually.

In 2018 the membership fee was 5000€/Project owner.

If your organisation is willing to support JDF work, please contact Communication Coordinator (info@oskari.org).  Memos are available in Finnish here since 2017.
