        p Oskari is an open source software for building web maps and displaying and analyzing geospatial data. Oskari supports the EU directive INSPIRE and OGC standards. 
        p This site contains technical instructions for using, configuring and developing the software. The documentation on this site assumes the reader is somewhat familiar with the basic geographical protocols used extensively in GIS applications, such as WMS (Web Map Service) and WFS (Web Feature Service).
        p Also, experience in JavaScript and/or Java development is required to read and understand the developer documentation.

              [How to subscribe](https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/oskari-user)

              It can be used to discuss anything between developers, PSC and other interested parties of the community. 

              The mailing list is open and search engines can find the discussion threads. This helps finding solutions for already asked questions.

              ### [Gitter](https://gitter.im/oskariorg/chat)
              For things that are more easily dealt with in a chat environment instead of emails. 

              If you need to ask something really quick or need more interactive collaboration you can use Gitter.
              The history of the chat discussions are lost rather quickly so we encourage to use the mailing list.
              Please chat in English so everyone can participate in the discussion.
